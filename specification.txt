# PWL Transformation and Scoping Specification

## Variable Scoping Rules

### Core Principles
1. Only variables of type 'x' (entities) should be introduced with ?[var]
2. Events ('e'), individuals ('i') and handles ('h') should NOT be scoped with ?[var]
3. An 'x' variable can only be referenced within an enclosing scope that introduces it 
4. Each entity variable's scope must be minimal while preserving access
5. Independent entity variables can have parallel scopes
6. Variables in inner scopes automatically have access to all variables from lexically enclosing scopes

## Transformation Pipeline

### Phase 1
Should look for:
1. proper_q(X1,..,A) 
2. proper_q(X2,..,B)
3. named(X1,s1)
4. named(X2,s2)
5. compound(e,X1,X2)

And rewrite this into:
```
temp_compound_name(X1,X2,A,B,s)
```

### Phase 2
Should rewrite:
```
temp_compound_name(X1,X2,A,B,s)
```
into a Formula structure that represents an equivalent logical form to:
```
proper_q(X1,named(X1,s1),A & B, carg=s1 + " " + s2)
```
The Formula structure must capture the variable bindings, argument dependencies, and combined name string in a form that phase 3 can serialize appropriately.

The data structure that represents predicates (EP) has a slot called CARG for named's string.
Use this slot for storing the combined string. In this way, no new predicates need to be generated and the handle map can 
remain fixed. 

Phase 2 will produce a hierarchical Formula that wraps an EP. It needs to store the first "x" variable in the quantifiers so that phase 3
can serialize results in the format described in phase 3.  In the concrete syntax "?[x]:" will preface the serialization of Formula EPs.
Example transformations for quantifiers:

### Phase 3
Phase 3 converts X2 to X1, eliminating it from all predicates.

### Phase 4
Phase 4 performs minimum scoping, described below.

There are two types of PWL syntax for scope.  The first, and typical case is existential
quantification and it uses the syntax "?[X]:".  The other is universal quantification
and it uses the syntax "![X]:".  X may be a single variable name or a comma delimited set of variable names.
It is important that the scope for universal quantification be tight, and that no other
variables mistakely get included in a universal quantification variable list. 
PWL universal quantification is connected with the every_q quantifier.   Other MRS/ERG _q quantifiers like
the_q or udef_q should have their variables be denoted with PWL existential quantifers.
Only if a universal and an existential MRS/ERG quantifier both reference the same variable may
there be both PWL existential and universal quantifier.  In these cases, the existential must be on the outside, wrapping the universal quanitifer.
The default, however, should be that there is either an existential or a universal quantifier but not both.

For example, this would be illegal:

```
?[x3]:(?[x8]:(/* every_q */ ![x8]:((_hate_v_1(e2, x3, x8) & person(x3) & person(x8)))))
```

## Example Final Output Format (after phase 5)
The serialized output should match this format and follow all scoping rules:

```
?[x3]:(
  ?[x46]:(
    live_v_1(x46, e53) &
    people_n_of(i52, x46) &
    only_a_1(x46, e51) &
    be_v_id(x46, x3, e45) &
    ?[x32]:(
      /* proper_q */ ?[n]:(name(n) & arg1(n)=x32 & arg2(n)="Dreadbury Mansion") &
      in_p_loc(x32, e30, e31)
    ) &
    ?[x8]:(
      /* proper_q */ ?[n]:(name(n) & arg1(n)=x8 & arg2(n)="Agatha") &
      ?[x14]:(
        ?[x19,x24]:(
          /* proper_q */ ?[n]:(name(n) & arg1(n)=x24 & arg2(n)="Charles") &
          butler_n_1(x19) &
          and_c(x24, x19, x14)
        ) &
        implicit_conj(x14, x8, x3)
      )
    )
  ) &
  live_v_1(x3, e30)
)
```

### Phase 5
Phase 5 serializes as below.

A quantifier predicate like:
```
proper_q(X1,named(X1,s1),A & B, carg=s1 + " " + s2)
```

will be serialized into:

```
/* proper_q */ (?[n]:(name(n) & arg1(n)=X1 & arg2(n)=(s1 + " " + s2) & AA))
```
